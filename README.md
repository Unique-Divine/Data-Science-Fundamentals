## Overview: Unique Divine - Regression Practice ##

This repository contains a few projects that I originally used for practice with implementing regression algorithms. My main goal was to reach a high level understanding of each concept, stick to best practices as much as possible, have organized and useful code documentation, and build some useful skills to apply to real world problems.  As a result, these projects gradually evolved more and more into tutorials that can serve as useful resources for those getting started in learning data science.

### TODO
- Brainstorm/ask around for ideas for projects 3 & 4 of this repo.
- Figure out how to convert the dataframe into an image so that you can link it to the README
