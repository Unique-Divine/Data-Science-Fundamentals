## Overview: Data Science Fundamentals ##

This repository contains some of the projects that I originally used for practice getting started in data science.

The notebooks were intended to help strengthen my skills with the some of the core pieces of end-to-end data science projects such as:
- Data Cleaning
- Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive Modeling w/ Machine Learning Algorithms : regression and classification (supervised learning) in addition to clustering (unsupervised learning)
- Model Evaluation

### My main goals while working through them:
- To make productive mistakes
- To build up understanding of how to implement basic machine learning algorithms
- To stick to coding best practices as much as possible, including organized, concise, and efficient code documentation
- To build useful skills that I can apply to more challenging real world problems.  

Throughout the process of working on all of these projects, I noticed that the notebooks I'd been making had gradually evolved into quite instruction and helpful resources for those getting started in learning data science.

### TODO
- Brainstorm ideas for projects 3 & 4 of this repo > Clustering and Classification > Consider Titanic or other similar dataset.
