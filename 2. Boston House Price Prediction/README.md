# Boston House Price Prediction

### Summary:

This purpose of this project is to serve as an example to showcase a typical data science workflow using the famous "Boston House" dataset. 

Although the notebook contains my own analysis, everything in it is written in the style of a tutorial. 
I assume an understanding of object-oriented programming in Python and assume no knowledge of statistical modeling and machine learning. 
In the "Predictive Modeling" section, a basic but thorough description of each algorithm is included in addition to some explanation about each algorithm's strengths and weaknesses.
